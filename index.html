            Hello! This is my home page, acting as a portfolio and a hub linking to my various accounts across the internet. I'm Torph, and I enjoy<br>
            low-level programming in various assembly languages, C, and C++. I'm obssessed with efficient software, rendering, and all things 3D art.
            I also like to mod games, mainly Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
        </p>

            <a href="https://github.com/Torphedo/Renderer">Custom Renderer</a>
            <br>
            Language: C++<br>
            <br>
            A "2D" renderer written from scratch in C++ with an OpenGL backend. The renderer compiles to a statically linked library, which is used by a separate
            application project. The next goal for this project is to implement batched or instanced rendering for extra efficiency. After that, I want to
            try implementing a Vulkan backend. I also plan to add abstracted projection options (Orthographic & Perspective), and allow for 3D camera movement.

            <h4>Phantom Dust Skill Editor</h4>
            Language: C and C++<br>
            <br>
            This tool is designed to tamper with the memory of the game Phantom Dust, to allow modders to safely create and distribute new skills (similar to spells)
            without needing to use a hex editor. It allows you to change parameters on different attacks and see your changes in real time, and will even stop you
            from crashing the game in certain ways. It also changes the version number when a mod is installed, which both prevents online cheaters from abusing the
            tool, and forces modded players to be using the EXACT same mods as their opponents in order to network with each other, eliminating lots of potential
            crashes. Because a critical part of the tool is preventing cheaters from using it in public matches, I've kept it closed-source. It runs on Dear imgui
            with Vulkan and GLFW as the graphical backend.

            <br>
            Language: C++<br>
            <br>
            A tool that reads a binary terrain metadata file from Breath of the Wild. The data is then emitted to YAML so that it can be easily read. The
            original intent was to also read YAML and turn it back into the binary format, but that idea has been abandoned in favor of a visual editor in
            the upcoming BOTW map editor.

            Language: C++<br>
            <br>
            This repository has more than just a C++ project. It contains a small tool and 010 Editor binary templates for reading and reverse-engineering files
            from the 2004 game Phantom Dust. The tool isn't especially useful, all things considered, but the binary templates allow for easier editing of deck
            files and camera animations.

        <h3>Mods</h3>

            <a href="https://github.com/Torphedo/BOTW-ControllerAPI">Controller API</a>
            <br>
            Language: PowerPC Assembly<br>
            <br>
            A mod for Breath of the Wild written in PowerPC assembly. This mod allows you to create custom button combos, and when you trigger them, play a custom
            eventflow script. With some creative thinking, you can use this to do anything from custom menus to entirely new combat moves.

            <a href="https://github.com/Torphedo/shipbreaker-cheats-1">Shipbreaker Cheats</a>
            <br>
            Language: C#<br>
            <br>
            A mod for Hardspace: Shipbreaker that re-enables some debug features left by the developers. This was originally distributed as an edited copy of
            BBI.Unity.Game.dll, but that was...questionably legal, and extremely impractical. It's now a BepInEx plugin, which compiles to a tiny 10KB DLL.
            The mod enables classic cheats like noclip and god mode, plus options for infinite supplies, free tool upgrades, and more powerful cutting lasers.
            There used to be custom keybinds that allowed you to slow down time, instantly refill on air, and vaporize large swaths of metal. But the code to
            enable new keybinds broke in the 1.0 release, and I haven't found a way to fix it yet.

            <a href="https://github.com/Torphedo/AltStart">Alternate Start Locations</a>
            <br>
            Language: N/A<br>
            <br>
            A mod for Zelda: Breath of the Wild which wildly changes the start of the game by allowing you to start in any village and skip the Great Plateau,
            inspired by the
            <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272/">Alternate Start</a>
            mod for Skyrim. The mod includes compatability with another mod called Second Wind, which adds an entirely new village near Serenne Stable. If
            Second Wind is installed, Ordon Village will appear as an extra option in the town selection menu.
